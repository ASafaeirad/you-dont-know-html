This one’s a bit tricky, but here’s the breakdown:

### Understanding “normal elements” and end tag omission

In HTML, elements like <H>{'<div>'}</H> are considered normal elements. According to the spec:

> The start and end tags of certain normal elements can be omitted. [Spec reference](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#normal-elements)

However, for <H>{'<div>'}</H>, the element definition clearly states:

> Tag omission in text/html:
>
> Neither tag is omissible. [Spec reference](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element)

So, semantically valid HTML must include both <H>{'<div>'}</H> and <H>{'</div>'}</H>.

### But why does it still work in browsers?

This is where the HTML parser spec comes in — particularly the ["in body" insertion mode](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inbody). This defines how HTML parsers should behave.

From the spec:

> An end tag whose tag name is one of: `div`, `section`, `article` ...
>
> **If there is no matching open element on the stack**
>
> It's a parse error and the token is ignored.
>
> **Otherwise:**
>
> Generate implied end tags.

In short, the parser will generate implied end tags for any unclosed normal elements.

    <div>FullstacksJS</div>
  </div>
