The parser automatically closes the first `p` tag when facing the next opening `p` tag.

### Why?
There's a rule for that in the spec:

> A `p` element's end tag may be omitted if the `p` element is immediately followed by an
> `address`, `article`, `p`, `aside`, [...] or if there is no more content in the parent element and the parent element is an HTML element that is not an
> `a`, `audio`, `del`, [...], `ins` element, or an autonomous custom element. [Spec reference](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#normal-elements)

Then the parser will create the second `p` element for `<p></p>`.

And finally the parser will create the third `p` element when it encounters the closing `</p>` tag.

### Why?

When the parser is in [in body insertion mode](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inbody), and encounters a token for closing `p` tag, it must follow this algorithm:

> **An end tag whose tag name is `p`**
>
> If the stack of open elements does not have a `p` element in button scope, then this is a parse error;
> insert an HTML element for a `p` start tag token with no attributes.
>
> Close a `p` element. ([I don't recommend opening this link](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#close-a-p-element))
