> The term being defined is identified following these rules: [Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dfn#usage_notes)
>
> 1. If the <H>{"<dfn>"}</H> element has a title attribute, the value of the title attribute is considered to be the term being defined. The element must still have text within it, but that text may be an abbreviation (perhaps using <H>{"<abbr>"}</H>) or another form of the term.
> 2. If the <H>{"<dfn>"}</H> contains a single child element and does not have any text content of its own, and the child element is an <H>{"<abbr>"}</H> element with a title attribute itself, then the exact value of the <H>{"<abbr>"}</H> element's title is the term being defined.
> 3. Otherwise, the text content of the <H>{"<dfn>"}</H> element is the term being defined. This is shown in the first example below.
