<H>{"<s>"}</H> is used to show text that's no longer relevant—like outdated prices, discontinued products, or replaced content.

In this case, $49.99 is no longer the actual price, so it's visually and semantically appropriate to strike it out with <H>{"<s>"}</H>.

## Why not <H>{"<del>"}</H> or <H>{"<strike>"}</H>?

- <H>{"<strike>"}</H> is obsolete — non-semantic, just visual.
- <H>{"<del>"}</H> means something was removed—usually from a document, like in version control or edits. It implies a change in content, not just outdated info.
- <H>{"<ins>"}</H> is for newly added content (which isn't strictly necessary here unless you're tracking edits).
