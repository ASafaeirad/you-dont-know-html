So the code is a valid HTML syntax and is equivalent to:

```html
<table border>
  <caption>Caption</caption>
  <colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

The table has 4 columns.
