The <H>\<code></H> tag is used for Representing computer code

```html
<code>echo "Hello, FullstacksJS"</code>
```

This represents a command-line instruction, which is code that a user would type into a terminal. That’s exactly what the <H>\<code></H> element is for—marking up a snippet of code inline.

The <H>\<samp></H> tag is used for Sample output from a program or command

```html
<samp name="result">Hello, FullstacksJS</samp>
```

This is the output you get after running the code. The <H>\<samp></H> tag semantically represents what the computer outputs, often used in documentation or tutorials.
