> The <H>{'<code>'}</H> HTML element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code)

```html
<code>echo "Hello, FullstacksJS"</code>
```

This represents a command-line instruction, which is code that a user would type into a terminal. That's exactly what the <H>{'<code>'}</H> element is forâ€”marking up a snippet of code inline.

> The <H>{'<samp>'}</H> HTML element is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp)

```html
<samp name="result">Hello, FullstacksJS</samp>
```

This is the output you get after running the code. The <H>{'<samp>'}</H> tag semantically represents what the computer outputs, often used in documentation or tutorials.
