> The `inert` global attribute is a Boolean attribute indicating that the element and all of its flat tree descendants become inert.
>
> ### Inert does the following:
> * Prevents the `click` event from being fired when the user clicks on the element.
> * Prevents the `focus` event from being raised by preventing the element from gaining focus.
> * Prevents any contents of the element from being found/matched during any use of the browser's find-in-page feature.
> * Prevents users from selecting text within the element â€” akin to using the CSS property `user-select` to disable text selection.
> * Prevents users from editing any contents of the element that are otherwise editable.
> * Hides the element and its content from assistive technologies by excluding them from the accessibility tree.
